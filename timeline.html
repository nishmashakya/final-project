						<h3>2020+</h3>
						<p>The influencer culture industry continues to grow and adapt to the everchanging technologies, especially with social media. Recently we have seen the emergence of many types of influencers, from micro-influencers (those with smaller followings who are seen as more "trustworthy") to macro-influencers (those with much larger followings, and a popular target for brand collabs). We've also seen a lot of sponsoring of content, the use of AI, and much more. </p>

			<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
			<p>Trends come and go, and influencers come and go. Throughout history, the rise of social media platforms have made influencers one of the most powerful marketing tools for brands. While that means a bright future for influencers, it also means a lot of content put out there that is constantly being consumed by users of these platforms.</p>
