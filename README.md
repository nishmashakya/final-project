This is a multi-page informational that touches on a significant part of social media: influencer culture. I wanted to make a website to talk about the interaction between influencers and consumers, and show both sides of the equation. 

Note: I did not go super in-depth in terms of content, but that is something Iâ€™d like to add in the future.
